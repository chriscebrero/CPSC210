Since ServiceRecord includes all the service records, then add a new service "Discount" will not actually change
anything. Firstly, a enumeration "Discount" should be added to ServiceType class.

Then, few constant static variables shoule be set:
    public static int DISCOUNT_CALLOUT = 0;
    public static int DISCOUNT_SERVICE_HOURLY = 80;
    public static int DISCOUNT_SERVICEPTS_BASE = 0;
    public static int DISCOUNT_SERVICEPTS_HOURLY = 0;

Based on the requirements that there is no callout fee, no service points and $80 hourly service fee is charged.


Also, DiscountServiceRecord is the subclass of AbstractServiceRecord, the abstract methods
getServicePoints, getCalloutFee, getServiceFee must be implemented.
